# MetroBike
Python Data Analysis of MetroBike dataset.

This repository includes TWO Jupyter Notebooks:
1. RawData_Clean_Organize.ipynb
  This notebook loads three csv data sets for the 
    -MetroBike trips data 
    -Kiosk  location data
  -Community Survey data

  The notebook adds some columns, removes some trips/rows from the dataframe, and creates subsets of the trips data frame to analyze. Lastly, the processed/cleaned data is saved as csv files. 

 2. Data_Analysis_Visualizations.ipynb
 
  T his notebook loads the cleaned csv files and creates a series of data visualizations. 

Secondly, this repository includes a
    -"Data" folder that includes the raw and processed data. Data are zipped due to their large sizes.

Lastly, my project slides (presentation) is included:
