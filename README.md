# MetroBike
Python Data Analysis of MetroBike dataset (https://data.austintexas.gov/).

This repository includes THREE Jupyter Notebooks:
1. RawData_Clean_Organize.ipynb

This notebook loads three csv data sets for the (a) MetroBike trips data, (b) Kiosk  location data, (c) Community Survey data. Further, the notebook adds some columns, removes some trips/rows from the dataframe, and creates subsets of the trips data frame to analyze. Lastly, the processed/cleaned data is saved as csv files. 

2. Data_Analysis_Visualizations.ipynb
 
This notebook loads the cleaned csv files and creates a series of data visualizations. 

3. Final_Visualizations_forWriteUp.ipynb

This notebook includes additional visualizations for my final project write-up: https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/metrobike-austin-a-python-data-analysis/

#------------------------------------------
Secondly, this repository includes a
4. "Data" folder that includes the raw and processed data files. Data are zipped due to their large sizes.

Lastly, my project slides (presentation, Nov 5, 2021) is included:
